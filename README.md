# CSharpCompiler

This is a coursework of Daniil Dudkin and Alina Turitsyna of a Software Engineering Department class dedicated to Compiler Development. 

The project can compile simple C# programs to Java bytecode. You can find examples of possible programs [here](https://github.com/unterumarmung/CSharpCompiler/tree/master/Compiler/Tests).

The compiler is written in C++17. Code may be weird and messyðŸ™ˆ.
